# WineQuality-Red-PyCaret

The purpose of this notebook is to examine and evaluate the Regression models using PyCaret, a Python machine learning library, on a Red Wine Quality Dataset. The dataset is provided by UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The three models that were examined are Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Linear Regression and Least Angle Regression. The choices were taken based on their MAE, MSE and R2 scores and their Training Time. The three models gave some of the best results compared to the other 20 models. However, during the evaluation steps, only the Light Gradient Boosting Machine model was chosen to be finalized, saved and used model to give the final prediction results.
